class TemplatedCatalog(object):
  """A backend that generates endpoints for the Catalog based on templates.

  It is usually configured via config entries that look like:

    catalog.$REGION.$SERVICE.$key = $value

  and is stored in a similar looking hierarchy. Where a value can contain
  values to be interpolated by standard python string interpolation that look
  like (the % is replaced by a $ due to paste attmepting to interpolate on its
  own:

    http://localhost:$(public_port)s/

  When expanding the template it will pass in a dict made up of the options
  instance plus a few additional key-values, notably tenant_id and user_id.

  It does not care what the keys and values are but it is worth noting that
  keystone_compat will expect certain keys to be there so that it can munge
  them into the output format keystone expects. These keys are:

    name - the name of the service, most likely repeated for all services of
           the same type, across regions.
    adminURL - the url of the admin endpoint
    publicURL - the url of the public endpoint
    internalURL - the url of the internal endpoint
